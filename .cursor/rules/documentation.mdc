* **Doc ≠ Spec** → prioritize *executable clarity* (tests, typings, comments) over prose.
* Write **only what helps the next developer (or LLM) understand the intent**, not the reasoning.
* **No auto-generated docs** unless explicitly requested.
* **Prefer self-explanatory code**: strong types, clear names, test coverage.
* If documentation is required:
  * Ask user **before creating or expanding** it.
  * Limit to short contextual notes (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or inline comments).
* Keep the **root `README.md`** up to date with:
  * Startup / setup walkthrough
  * Troubleshooting tips
  * Nothing else
* Optimize for **token economy** — brevity > completeness.
